# Color palette for the 256 color form that many terminal applications use.
# The syntax of this configuration is `N=COLOR` where `N` is 0 to 255 (for
# the 256 colors in the terminal color table) and `COLOR` is a typical RGB
# color code such as `#AABBCC` or `AABBCC`, or a named X11 color.
#
# The palette index can be in decimal, binary, octal, or hexadecimal.
# Decimal is assumed unless a prefix is used: `0b` for binary, `0o` for octal,
# and `0x` for hexadecimal.
#
# For definitions on the color indices and what they canonically map to,
# [see this cheat sheet](https://www.ditig.com/256-colors-cheat-sheet).
