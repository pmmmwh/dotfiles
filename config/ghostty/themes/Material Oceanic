# Color palette for the 256 color form that many terminal applications use.
# The syntax of this configuration is `N=HEXCODE` where `N` is 0 to 255 (for
# the 256 colors in the terminal color table) and `HEXCODE` is a typical RGB
# color code such as `#AABBCC`.
#
# For definitions on all the codes [see this cheat
